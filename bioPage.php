      <h3><i>Greetings</i>, my name is Chris.</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>Here is a little bit about me: </h4>
      <br>
      <p>
      <h5>I am 25 years old & I currently reside in Texas.
      <br>
      When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones, reading, or skating.
      I am a free thinker & a curious soul.
      <br>
      <br>

      Throughout my journey in computer programming, I started off learning the back-end with Python.<br>
      After that I went deep into the front-end with JavaScript and various other technologies.<br>
      Once I was conditioned with building exquisite user interfaces and experiences I went on to learn MySQL.<br>
      Databases are a thrill to me and I learned a vast amount of information on that journey.<br>
      I have been a System Administrator for a year on my own server, as well as hosting and developing my own web applications.<br>
